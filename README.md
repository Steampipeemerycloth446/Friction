## Overview

Friction is an Android application designed to reduce doomscrolling through intentional friction. It imposes resistance on social media platforms, converting unconscious scrolling into mindful digital behavior.

Friction R5 'Inception' delivers refined scroll detection, multi-layered friction strategies, and a minimalist interface focused on digital wellness.

### ***Friction basically just unscrolls your feed (after the limit) and gives you a total ragebait.***

## **Break the scroll. Reclaim your focus.**

## Features

### Core Functionality
- **Scroll Awareness**: Tracks daily scroll count across blacklisted social media apps
- **Daily Limit System**: Hard limit that resets each day (configurable range: 1-10,000, default: 500)
- **Lag Mode**: Activates friction resistance once the daily limit is reached
- **Multi-Strategy Friction Engine**: Adapts to different app types using:
  - Node-based backward scroll
  - Root node fallback
  - Gesture-based swipe opposition (200ms upward swipe)

### Monitored Applications
- Instagram & Threads
- TikTok (all variants)
- YouTube (Shorts, feed)
- Twitter / X
- Snapchat
- Reddit
- Facebook & Messenger
- LinkedIn
- Pinterest
- BeReal
- Tumblr

### Technical Architecture
- **AccessibilityService**: Real-time scroll event interception
- **Foreground Service**: Persistent operation with low-priority notification
- **Boot Receiver**: Automatic restart after device reboot
- **Session-based Scroll Detection**: Groups rapid scrolls into single sessions (600ms window)

### User Interface
- Dark, minimal aesthetic
- Purple accent for interactive elements
- Clean setup flow for limit configuration
- Dashboard showing remaining scrolls and lag mode status

## Installation

1. Disable Google Play Protect scanning via Play Store > Settings > Play Protect > Settings icon (top-right) > Disable "Scan apps with Play Protect"
2. Download and install `Friction-R5.apk` on Android 8.0+ (API 26+)
3. Grant Accessibility Service permission via Settings > Accessibility > Services >  Friction Scroll Awareness
4. Disable battery optimizations for uninterrupted operation
5. Configure your daily scroll limit during first launch (locked after initial setup)

## Requirements

- **Minimum SDK**: 26 (Android 8.0 Oreo)
- **Target SDK**: 35 (Android 15)
- **Permissions**: 
  - `BIND_ACCESSIBILITY_SERVICE`
  - `POST_NOTIFICATIONS`
  - `FOREGROUND_SERVICE`
  - `RECEIVE_BOOT_COMPLETED`
  - `REQUEST_IGNORE_BATTERY_OPTIMIZATIONS`

## How It Works

1. **Setup**: User configures daily scroll limit (one-time, locked after)
2. **Monitoring**: Service listens for scroll events in blacklisted apps
3. **Counting**: Each scroll session increments the daily counter
4. **Activation**: When limit reached, lag mode triggers friction
5. **Friction**: Opposing scroll or swipe gestures create intentional resistance

## Configuration

### Accessibility Service Config (`res/xml/accessibility_service_config.xml`)
- Event types: `TYPE_WINDOW_STATE_CHANGED`, `TYPE_VIEW_SCROLLED`
- Feedback: Generic (non-intrusive)
- Flags: Include non-important views, retrieve interactive windows

### Constants
- `MAX_SCROLL_LIMIT`: 10,000
- `DEFAULT_SCROLL_LIMIT`: 500
- `SCROLL_SESSION_TIMEOUT_MS`: 600ms
- `LAG_SCROLL_DELAY_MS`: 120ms
- `SECOND_REVERSE_SCROLL_DELAY_MS`: 150ms
